# Python Core Concepts

This repository contains small Python mini-projects created to revise and strengthen core Python fundamentals.

Each project focuses on a single Python concept such as input/output, conditionals, loops, data structures, and basic error handling.

## Concepts Covered
- Print and input
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Break and continue
- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Basic exception handling

## Purpose
- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Practice concept-wise programming
- Build a strong base for Machine Learning

## How to Use
- Each folder/file represents one Python concept
- Run the `.py` files using Python 3

This repository is part of my learning journey as a B.Tech CSE (AI & ML) student.
