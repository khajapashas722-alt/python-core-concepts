# Python Core Concepts

This repository contains small Python mini-projects created to revise and strengthen core Python fundamentals.

Each project focuses on a single Python concept, gradually progressing from basics to more advanced topics.

## Concepts Covered
- Print and input
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Break and continue
- Lists
- Tuples and tuple unpacking
- Sets
- Functions and return values
- String methods
- File handling
- Exception handling (try / except)
- Lambda functions
- List comprehensions
- Variable scope (global)
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes & objects)
- Modules and packages
- Generators and yield

## Purpose
- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Practice concept-wise programming
- Build a strong base for Machine Learning and technical interviews

## How to Use
- Each file or folder demonstrates one Python concept
- Run the `.py` files using Python 3
- Read the comments inside each file for understanding

This repository is part of my learning journey as a B.Tech CSE (AI & ML) student.
